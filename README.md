 Cryptocurrency has attained immense popularity in recent years and is considered a significant asset among investors and media. Most of the research in the past emphasises on Bitcoin; whereas, a division of the crypto coins popularly known as the Forked coins have not yet been deeply investigated. This paper primarily aims to predict the closing prices of two fork coins, namely Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), as part of Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies group. The prediction is a result of an hourly analysis of Open, High, Close And Volume(OHLCV) data provided by the Kaiko website and comparing modern algorithms such as 1) LSTM Deep  Learning Algorithm,  2)Xtreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost),3)Facebookâ€™s forecasting model PROPHET, and traditional time series 4)ARIMA model. Furthermore, the results were evaluated with RMSE   performance metrics. Experimental results of this research indicate that the LSTM deep learning model outperforms other models for both the forked coins followed by ARIMA. The study concludes that the modern algorithm performs efficiently because of the error rate through the traditional ARIMA model.
